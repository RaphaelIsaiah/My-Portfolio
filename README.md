# My-Portfolio
List of things to do:
Make copies of all the projects I have done so far as individual repos.
Make improvements on some of the projects by adding JS to them for better functionality and responsiveness.
Host the different projects on either github or vercel.
Add a more and less functionality to the portfolio site...
Add little lemon project from coursera and the calculator project...
Ensure that proper open graph protocols are added to all projects.
